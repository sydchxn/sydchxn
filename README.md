# **Hi there! I’m Sydney!** 
Passionate UI/UX designer and product manager with a strong foundation in creating user-centered digital experiences.

I’m currently a 3rd year majoring in Psychological Science and Informatics @ UC Irvine, where I combine my love for design and technology to craft meaningful, intuitive products.

With experience in both design and management, I enjoy taking projects from ideation all the way through to execution. I focus on user research, prototyping, and product strategy, ensuring that the end result is not only visually appealing but also solves real problems for users. My background in diverse fields, including full-stack development, gives me a well-rounded approach to building products that not only look good, but also do good for the people and the planet 🌎!
